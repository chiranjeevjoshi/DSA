/*
 * Monk has 
N
N friends. They are invited to his birthday party. Each friend has a satisfying factor which is equal to the number of gifts which they are expecting. Monk wants to satisfy at-least 
K
K friends but he is unaware of their satisfying factors. So Monk starts distribution of gifts. As soon as a friend is satisfied he won't take more gifts.

Monk will follow a distribution strategy so as to minimize the number of gifts needed to satisfy atleast 
K
K of his friends. Find the minimum number of gifts which Monk should carry with himself in the worst case.

Input Format

First line contains an integer 
T
T (the number of testcases).

Then first line of each test case contains an integer 
N
N (the number of friends).

Then 
N
N space separated integers follow which are the satisfying factor(
S
[
i
]
S[i]).

Last line of each test case consists of an integer 
K
K.
